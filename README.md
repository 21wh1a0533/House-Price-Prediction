#House Price Prediction Project
This project focuses on predicting house prices using a Machine Learning model based on the Random Forest Regressor algorithm. The model is trained on a dataset that includes various features such as location, area size, number of rooms, and more. By leveraging the power of ensemble learning, the model achieves a high prediction accuracy of 91.67%.

**Project Overview:**
- Algorithm: Random Forest Regressor, an ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees to improve predictive performance and reduce overfitting.
- Accuracy: The model demonstrates 91.67% accuracy in predicting house prices.
- Flask Web Interface: A simple yet interactive Flask-based web application allows users to input property details and receive real-time price predictions.
- Data Features: The dataset includes key variables such as location, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, total area, and other property features that influence pricing.
  
**Key Features:**
- Real-time Price Prediction: Users can input features like the number of rooms, area, and location to get an instant house price prediction.
- Model Performance: The Random Forest Regressor ensures robust performance by reducing overfitting and handling missing data or outliers effectively.
- User-friendly Interface: A clean and simple web UI, built with Flask, offers ease of use for users to interact with the model and obtain predictions quickly.
- 
**Future Enhancements:**
- Incorporating additional features such as property age, neighborhood quality, and proximity to amenities.
- Adding data visualization tools to allow users to explore trends in the dataset.
- Implementing a backend database to store user inputs and predictions for future analysis.
